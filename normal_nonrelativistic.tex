    Using the non relativistic Schr\"odinger equation, the ground state
    wave-function for a hydrogenic atom is given by
    equation~\ref{eq:schrodinger-ground}.
    The corresponding electron density for the ground state is given by
    \(
        \rho(\mb{r}) = \psi_{1s}^{*} \psi_{1s} 
                     = \frac{1}{\pi a_{0}^{3}} e^{-Zr/a_0}
    \).
    We know that for a hydrogenic atom we can assume spherical symmetry,
    and therefore by substituting the charge density into
    equation~\ref{eq:nff-spherical} we get the non relativistic normal 
    form factor for hydrogenic atoms.
    \begin{equation*}
        f_0(q) = \frac{4}{q} \left( \frac{Z}{a_0} \right)^3
                 \int_0^\infty e^{-2Zr/a_0} \sin(qr) r \; dr
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:nff-nonrelativistic}
        \boxed{
            f_0(q) = \left( \frac{2Z}{a_0} \right)^4 
                     \left[ \left( \frac{2Z}{a_0} \right)^2 + q^2 \right]^{-2} 
        }
    \end{equation}
    Here we have $q = 4\pi \sin(\theta/2)/\lambda$ $\InvAngstrom$ as stated earlier. This
    result was has also been obtained by Hubbell~\cite{Hubbell-1975} and
    Pirenne~\cite{Pirenne}, however in a slightly modified form due to a
    different definition of $q$ which does not include the factor of $4\pi$.
